# loxone-planner

Usage:

groovy planner.groovy input.ods output.ods

You must derive your document from example/input.ods, because column indexes etc.. are hardcoded into script.
Then you will see what is connected, what is not and where are the problems by colors in output.ods.

Also watch the console, there are errors reported during checks.
